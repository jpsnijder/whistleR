Welcome to whistleR, a collection of data-cleaning functions. #CleanAsAWhistle

Each function requires the following parameters:

data = target dataframe,
subjVar =  subject/ID variable,
vars = list of manipulated variables at which the data should be split for cleaning. If only at the subject level = leave blank,
value = name of value column (e.g., RT),
new_df = name for cleaned dataframe,
st.d. = number of standard deviations (e.g., 2.5),
minRT  = IF RT; lower bound cutoff point,
minACC = IF Acc/Error; lower bound cutoff of accuracy. 

Example of function call (copy-able): 

RT.win(data = dataframeName,
       subjVar = "ID",
       vars = c("condition_1", "condition_2", "condition_n"),
       value = "RT",
       new_df = "winsorizedDF",
       st.d = 3,
       minRT = 250)
      
Cleaning Functions: RT.win(), RT.cut(), ACC.win(), ACC.cut()
Help Function: whistleR.help()
